# cushy-clicker

This repository shows a proof of concept of how to use
[Cushy](https://github.com/khonsulabs/cushy) to build a clicker/incremental
game. While Cushy is early in development and is lacking some important complex
widgets, many great incremental games are primarily text and buttons.

For developers looking to make a clicker or incremental game in Rust, consider
using Cushy. It's author enjoys playing them, and not only might be a play
tester, he is also very proactive in addressing feedback to Cushy itself.

To run the example:

```sh
cargo run --example simple
```
